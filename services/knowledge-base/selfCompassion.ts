Self-compassion involves treating yourself with the same kindness, concern, and support you’d show to a good friend. 
It means accepting that to be human is to be imperfect. 
It has three main components: 
1.  **Self-Kindness:** Being warm and understanding toward ourselves when we suffer, fail, or feel inadequate, rather than ignoring our pain or flagellating ourselves with self-criticism.
2.  **Common Humanity:** Recognizing that suffering and personal inadequacy are part of the shared human experience – something that we all go through rather than being something that happens to "me" alone.
3.  **Mindfulness:** Taking a balanced approach to our negative emotions so that feelings are neither suppressed nor exaggerated.
A simple tip is to ask yourself, 'What would I say to a friend who was going through this?'. Then, try to direct those same words of kindness and support inward.
