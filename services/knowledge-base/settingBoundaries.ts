Boundaries are the limits and rules we set for ourselves within relationships. 
Healthy boundaries are essential for self-esteem and maintaining healthy relationships. 
Not having boundaries can lead to resentment, anger, and burnout. 
Setting a boundary can feel difficult or uncomfortable because you might fear disappointing others. 
Examples include saying 'no' to requests that drain your energy, limiting contact with people who are not respectful of your feelings, and protecting your personal time.
A simple way to start is by using 'I' statements. 
For example, instead of saying 'You're asking too much of me,' you could say, 'I feel overwhelmed with my current workload and don't have the capacity to take on that task right now.' This communicates your needs without placing blame.
