The inner critic is that voice inside your head that judges, demeans, and doubts you. 
It often sounds like a critical parent or authority figure. This voice can undermine your confidence and contribute to feelings of low self-worth, anxiety, and sadness. 
The inner critic often uses harsh language, points out your flaws, and compares you unfavorably to others. 
It might say things like 'You're not good enough' or 'You're going to fail.'
A helpful technique to manage the inner critic is to name it and separate it from your own voice. 
When you hear critical thoughts, you can say to yourself, 'My inner critic is being loud today.' 
This act of noticing and labeling the voice creates a separation, reminding you that its judgments are thoughts, not facts.
