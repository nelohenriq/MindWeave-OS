Burnout is a state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by excessive and prolonged stress. 
It occurs when you feel overwhelmed, emotionally drained, and unable to meet constant demands. 
Key signs include:
1.  **Exhaustion:** Feeling drained and depleted, lacking the energy to face the day.
2.  **Cynicism and Detachment:** Feeling negative about your job or life, and distancing yourself from your work and colleagues.
3.  **Reduced Efficacy:** A sense of ineffectiveness and lack of accomplishment. You may feel that your contributions no longer make a difference.
A crucial step in managing burnout is to prioritize rest and recovery. 
Schedule short breaks throughout your day, ensure you are getting adequate sleep, and consciously disconnect from work-related tasks and communications during your off-hours.
