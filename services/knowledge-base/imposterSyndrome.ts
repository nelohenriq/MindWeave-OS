Imposter syndrome is an internal psychological experience of feeling like a phony in some area of your life, despite any success youâ€™ve achieved. 
People experiencing it often feel like they don't deserve their accomplishments and live in fear of being exposed as a 'fraud'. 
Common feelings include self-doubt, anxiety, and a sense that you've deceived others into thinking you're more intelligent or competent than you believe yourself to be. 
It often co-occurs with perfectionism.
An actionable tip to combat imposter syndrome is to keep an 'accomplishments list'. 
Write down your successes, big and small. When feelings of doubt creep in, review this list to remind yourself of tangible evidence of your competence and hard work.
