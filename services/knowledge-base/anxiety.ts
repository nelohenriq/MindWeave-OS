Anxiety is the body's natural response to stress. It's a feeling of fear or apprehension about what's to come. 
Common symptoms include feelings of nervousness, restlessness, or being tense; having a sense of impending danger, panic, or doom; 
having an increased heart rate; breathing rapidly (hyperventilation); sweating; and trembling. 
While occasional anxiety is a normal part of life, people with anxiety disorders frequently have intense, excessive, and persistent worry and fear about everyday situations.
A simple grounding technique to manage a moment of anxiety is the 5-4-3-2-1 method. 
Acknowledge 5 things you can see around you, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste. This helps reconnect you with the present moment.
