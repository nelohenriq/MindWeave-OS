Cognitive distortions are irrational or exaggerated thought patterns that can cause us to perceive reality inaccurately. 
These automatic thoughts are often subtle and can contribute to negative emotional states like anxiety and depression. 
Common examples include:
1.  **Black-and-White Thinking:** Seeing things in absolute, all-or-nothing terms. If a situation falls short of perfect, you see it as a total failure.
2.  **Catastrophizing:** Expecting the worst-case scenario to happen, without considering more likely and less dramatic outcomes.
3.  **Personalization:** Believing that you are responsible for events that are, in reality, outside of your control.
A helpful tip to challenge a cognitive distortion is to ask yourself: 'Is there another way to look at this situation?' or 'What evidence do I have that this thought is 100% true?'. This creates distance and allows for a more balanced perspective.
