Mindfulness is the practice of purposely bringing one's attention to the present moment without judgment. 
It involves being fully aware of where we are and what we’re doing, rather than being overly reactive or overwhelmed by what’s going on around us. 
Mindfulness doesn't eliminate stress or difficult feelings, but it can help us respond to them in a calmer manner. 
Common feelings associated with a lack of mindfulness include feeling scattered, overwhelmed, or like you're on 'autopilot'.
A simple way to practice mindfulness is through 'mindful breathing'. 
Take a moment to focus on your breath. Notice the sensation of the air entering your nostrils, filling your lungs, and then leaving your body. 
When your mind wanders, gently guide it back to your breath. Try this for just one minute.
